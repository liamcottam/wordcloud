# WordCloud

A quick and dirty implementation of a wordcloud in Go. You will need to bring your own ranking/word size algorithms, this library just attempts to place the words in the best place possible in a spiral formation.

## Usage

TODO - However you can see an example in [cmd/example](cmd/example).

## Attribution

The spiral is directly based on [this](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral#Go).
